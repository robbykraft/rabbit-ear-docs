# Rabbit Ear

Welcome. This is the technical documentation for [Rabbit Ear](https://rabbitear.org), an origami library for Javascript, able to be run in a front-end browser or in a back-end environment (Node.js).

To learn more about what this library does, check out [the book](https://rabbitear.org/book/) where there are plenty of interactable examples.

The source code is spread out across multiple repositories, each of which are available online: [Rabbit Ear](https://github.com/robbykraft/Origami), [Math](https://github.com/robbykraft/Math), [SVG](https://github.com/robbykraft/SVG).

## installation

npm i rabbit-ear
```

```text
// es
import ear from "rabbit-ear";
// umd
const ear = require("rabbit-ear");
