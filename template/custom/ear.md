# rabbit ear

Welcome. This is the technical documentation for [Rabbit Ear](https://rabbitear.org), an origami library for front or back-end Javascript.

Installing Rabbit Ear gives you access to the `ear` object, these docs describe the contents of this object.

For visual and interactive examples, check out [the book](https://rabbitear.org/book/).

> Rabbit Ear is in *alpha release*, it should not be used in production, its structure is subject to change.

## the sidebar

- <span class="img">â–¶</span> this object **contains** nested methods (functions can be containers too)
- ![constant](C.svg) this is a **constant** (boolean, number, string, object)
- ![function](F.svg) this is a **function**

<!-- - ![static](S.svg) this is a function with **static** properties or methods -->

## installation

To install Rabbit Ear on an HTML page, link [this CDN](https://robbykraft.github.io/Origami/rabbit-ear.js):

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://robbykraft.github.io/Origami/rabbit-ear.js"></script>
```

To install [Rabbit Ear in Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rabbit-ear):

```shell
npm i rabbit-ear
```

and include it in your project,

```typescript
// ES
import ear from "rabbit-ear";
```

```typescript
// CommonJS
const ear = require("rabbit-ear");
```

## general overview

Broadly, the library does a few things:

- [ear.graph](ear.graph.html): create and modify FOLD objects ([FOLD](https://github.com/edemaine/fold/blob/main/doc/spec.md) is the graph model which represents an origami)
- [ear.svg](ear.svg.html): draw SVG elements (including renderings of FOLD objects)
- [ear.math](ear.math.html): contains a small math library (mostly simple linear algebra and geometry intersection)
- [ear.axiom](ear.axiom.html) and [ear.singleVertex](ear.singleVertex.html) contains general origami-specific calculations.

### back-end SVG

In Node.js, in a terminal environment without a front-end, the **window** object does not exist. If you would like to generate virtual SVG elements, this library allows you to pair with [@xmldom/xlmdom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xmldom/xmldom); otherwise this pairing is unnecessary.

```typescript
const ear = require("rabbit-ear");
ear.window = require("@xmldom/xmldom");
```

> This is not necessary for React/Angular/Svelte apps. These environments still expose the window object.
